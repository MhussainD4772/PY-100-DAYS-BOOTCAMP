# 🐍 100 Days of Python - The Complete Python Bootcamp 🚀

Welcome to my **100 Days of Python Bootcamp** repository! This project documents my journey as I learn and apply Python programming concepts over 100 days. Each day consists of coding exercises, notes, and mini-projects.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is structured into daily folders, each containing Python scripts, exercises, and notes for that day.

100-Days-Python-Bootcamp/ ├── Day 1/ │ ├── main.py │ ├── notes.md │ └── exercises/ ├── Day 2/ ├── Day 3/ ├── ... ├── README.md ├── .gitignore


Each folder contains:
- **📌 Daily Code** → Python scripts for the day's exercises.
- **📝 Notes** → Summaries of key concepts and learnings.
